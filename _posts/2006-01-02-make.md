This task is going to introduce you to writing a basic html document. But you'll do it on paper, using a pen, for fifteen minutes. 
You're going to keep doing this until (hopefully) you can do it without making any mistakes and (ideally) by memory. It's important to be able to do this because this basic html document will form the basis for (almost) every html document you write in the future.
     
<a href="https://laura.makes.org/thimble/MTg5NjIxODg4MA==/my-first-page">This is the code</a> you're going to write out by hand. Be sure to copy it verbatim. Every quote, space, capitalisation and indentation is important. When you start writing more complex HTML & CSS you'll see why ;) 

You can be creative with your Hello World and include your name and a personal message.

If you make a small mistake that's ok, but if you make a big mistake then start again. If you manage to get to the end without making a mistake in under fifteen minutes, then start again, but this time doing it from memory.
     
At the end of the fifteen minutes you should have got through a few pages or sheets of paper and have something that resembles the Thimble code.
Take a photograph (or scan) of your handwritten code, and post them with a description in <a href="http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/training/html">the discussion forum</a>. You should include how many attempts it took for you to get to the end of the code. If you've found it frustrating mention that, but ask yourself why - is there anything you could do to alleviate this?
     
When you're done be sure and give your peers some feedback on their handwritten code.

# 2. HTML Hunting in the World Around you

Go out into the world and walk around your neighborhood taking photographs of stuff that has the same structure as HTML tags.
See a bunch of people waiting in line for a bus? Sounds like an &lt;ol&gt;. What about bricks that make up a wall? Could be a &lt;div&gt; or a &lt;li&gt;. Photograph whatever you think matches the kind of structure that you're looking for.
     
There are no wrong or right answers in this make. If you can state why you think something is the way that it is, then that's good enough.
     
Ideally you should aim to get two or three photographs for each of the <a href="http://www.99lime.com/_bak/topics/you-only-need-10-tags/">most common HTML tags.</a>
          
Everyone will get different results, but the important part is that you activate your mind to look for 'html like' structures in the world.

# 3. Bring it all together
Use Thimble to make a webpage that teaches someone else the most surprising thing you understood about HTML and making things with the building blocks of the web. You can remix to reflect or start from scratch. <a href="http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/training/html">Share your make</a> and <a href="https://webmaker.org/badges/composing-maker">apply for a badge</a>!
