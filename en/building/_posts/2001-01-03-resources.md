## Great Resources for Webmaking

KQED has produced excellent and easy to understand tutorials on two of the Webmaker tools:

## You Make, You Learn

### Everyone Can Teach

>To warm up to the idea of teaching, we then got into pairs. The task: teach someone something in 5 minutes.

>One person would go and then switch. Even if you knew what was being taught, you were encouraged to play a good learner, asking good questions and prompting the teacher.

>After this exercise, we circled up and discussed what we observed from this experience. For many, it was a great way to think about how to explain something clearly, using metaphors and knowledge building blocks. It helped bring people into a teaching mindset.

--Michelle Thorne "[Webmaker Train the Trainer](http://michellethorne.cc/2013/05/webmaker-train-the-trainer/)"

### Learning Objectives First

>Backward design is a method of designing educational curriculum by setting goals before choosing instructional methods and forms of assessment. Backward design of curriculum typically involves three stages:

>* identify the results desired
>* determine acceptable levels of evidence that support that the desired results have occurred
>* design activities that will make desired results happen

--Wikipedia "[Backward design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_design)"

### Learning Activities for Different Styles

>Consider the most popular kindergarten materials: blocks 
for building, crayons for drawing, dolls for role-playing, 
tiles for making geometric patterns. All of these materials 
are designed to encourage a child’s imagination. The 
materials do not over-constrain or over-determine. Children 
with different interests and different learning styles can all 
use the same materials, but each in his or her own personal 
way. 

>In developing technologies for older learners, we try to 
achieve a similar effect. Our guiding principle is “many 
paths, many styles” – that is, to develop technologies that 
can be used along many different paths, by children with 
many different styles...Our goal is to provide 
tools that can be used in multiple ways, leaving more room 
for children’s imaginations. 

--Mitch Resnick [All I Really Need to Know (All I Really Need to Know (About Creative Thinking) 
I Learned (By Studying How Children Learn) in Kindergarten*](http://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/CC2007-handout.pdf)

### How Do I Make a Learning Activity?

## "Making As Learning" in Online Communities

#### Digital Humanities 106: [The Daily Create](http://tdc.ds106.us/)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mozzadrella/13672820493" title="Screen Shot 2014-04-06 at 1.48.49 PM by Vanessa Gennarelli, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3739/13672820493_b9428db824.jpg" width="500" height="399" alt="Screen Shot 2014-04-06 at 1.48.49 PM"></a>


The Daily Create provides a space for regular practice of spontaneous creativity through challenges published every day. Each assignment should take no more than 15-20 minutes. There are no registrations, no prizes, just a community of people producing art daily. Developed as part of the ds106 open course on digital storytelling, TDC is open to anyone who wants a regular dose of creative exercises (and it more fun than jumping jacks, pushups, and P90X).

<a href="http://ds106.us/">DS106</a> began as a digital storytelling course offered for credit for students at the <a href="http://umw.edu/">University of Mary Washington</a>. 

And ds106 is also open to anyone interested in making digital art along with us and is truly an online community of learners beyond UMW. We have an <a href-="http:///assignments.ds106.us/">open collection of creativity assignments</a>, <a href="http://inspire.ds106.us/">a best of collection of participant works</a>, even an <a href="http://ds106.us/ds106-radio">internet radio station</a>.


#### Making Learning Connected: [Make Cycles](http://blog.nwp.org/clmooc/makes/make-cycles/)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mozzadrella/13672783905" title="Screen Shot 2014-04-06 at 2.00.21 PM by Vanessa Gennarelli, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5196/13672783905_6241943493.jpg" width="500" height="362" alt="Screen Shot 2014-04-06 at 2.00.21 PM"></a>

Making Learning Connected (#clmooc) is a collaborative, knowledge-building and sharing experience open to anyone who’s interested in making, creativity and learning. Together over six weeks we will play with new tools and processes for making projects, share our results and our learning, and explore the educational model known as Connected Learning. 


## The Design Process

### Paper Prototyping
>The sketchy feel of paper prototypes make them an effective tool to elicit users’ hands-on involvement during the design process, as they project the idea that things are still on the works and there is room for change. With paper prototypes, users are not only able to rapidly visualize the initial ideas of the design team, but can also feel empowered to adapt them to their own needs, and desires with the aid of the tangible materials.

--Catalina Naranjo-Bock, "[Using Paper Prototyping as a Tool for Participatory Design Research](http://www.paulolyslager.com/paper-prototyping-tool-participatory-design-research/)

### Participatory Design and the Web
>Codesign steps into an age of open source code and digital collaboration by uplevelling such interactions in an interesting way. In a codesign approach, ‘users’ and ‘stakeholders’ become partners, working actively side-by-side with designers to make things, shaping the definition and direction of a project together.

-Kat Baybrooke, "[A Mozilla winter: Web-makers, co-designers and curriculum-bakers…"](http://blog.kaibray.com/post/76615169574/a-mozilla-winter-web-makers-co-designers-and)

### Design Thinking in the Classroom

### Iteration and Reflection

>The practitioner allows himself to experience surprise, puzzlement, or confusion in a situation which he finds uncertain or unique. He reflects on the phenomenon before him, and on the prior understandings which have been implicit in his behaviour. He carries out an experiment which serves to generate both a new understanding of the phenomenon and a change in the situation.

--Donald Schön ["The Reflective Practioner"](http://infed.org/mobi/donald-schon-learning-reflection-change/) 

## Peers working in the Open

>I feel like folks forget they are the agents of their experiences.  We have agency.  Power. Control.  Maybe not over everything that happens.  Certainly not all.  But over more than we realize more often than not.

--Bud Hunt [In Search of Agency](http://budtheteacher.com/blog/2012/03/29/in-search-of-agency/)
