#Make to learn tech skills and concepts.

## 1. DIY Learning Experience

Plan and create a lesson plan that embeds web competencies and skills with the learning goals you're most interested in teaching. Start by using [Paper Prototyping] (https://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/paper/TeachingKitDesignCanvas.pdf) to organize your thoughts, then try remixing our [Teaching Kit Template](https://thimble.webmaker.org/project/10274/remix?ref=training) to help frame your lesson. Think about what activities you would run. You can search webmaker.org?ref=training for activities to try or make new activities with the help of the [Activity Template] (https://thimble.webmaker.org/project/10286/remix?ref=training).

Make note of which CC License you would like your kit to be under. For help with attributing images and other resources, <a href="http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/t/attributing-images/290">check out this thread</a> or take a course at the <a href="http://schoolofopen.org">School of Open</a>!

Publish and share your Teaching Kit with the [Discourse community](http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/training/building), and personally ask 2-3 people to review it for constructive feedback. Be sure to mention them with an @[name] when you post it.

<div class="gallery">
<div class="make-gallery row"></div>
</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
			var gallery = new MakeGallery(
			{
				tagPrefix: "webmaker:building-makeprompt",
				limit: 6
			},
			".make-gallery",
			{
	    		apiURL: "https://makeapi.webmaker.org",
                hidden: ["tags", "description"]
			});
</script>

## 2. Passion + Web + You = Learning

What are you personally passionate about? Is it existentialist philosophy, the cosmos, privacy, baking scones? 

Take a look at some of the Open Educational Resources (OERs) on Webmaker. You could use the [Create Your Own Comic](https://webmaker.makes.org/thimble/create-your-own-comic-a-starter-make) make and [remix it](https://webmaker.makes.org/thimble/create-your-own-comic-a-starter-make) to explain the basics of your passion. Or, use the [Mighty Jupiter](https://chadsansing.makes.org/thimble/webmaker-planet) template to share basic facts about your area of expertise.

Try to think about what sort of resources folks could *make* to show they've met the learning goals you outlined in your teaching kit. Then [find (or make!) examples](http://webmaker.org/starter-makes?ref=training). Be sure to include these resources in your Kit!

Share your make(s) with the [community](http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/training/building) and jot down a few other ideas about how you can add webmaking as an assignment. 

## 3. Observe a Community of Learners (and hack it!)

Go out into the wild of the Web and find an online community, or focus on an online community that you are part of. A few general ideas:

* [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/)
* [Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)

When you're looking at the community, examine how the community gives and receives feedback. 

* What are the "gestures"? (e.g. Favorites, shares, upvotes, contributions)
* Who in the community benefits from those feedback mechanisms? (e.g. Experts? Extroverts?)
* Who in the community does *not* benefit from those feedback mechanisms? (e.g. New people, learners who speak a language other than English).
* How would you change that system to produce more constructive feedback? Paper prototype your idea for a feedback feature and share it in the [Discourse community](http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/training/building).

## Make & Curate to Reflect
* Which resources did you consult for your make? Wikipedia pages? Stack Overflow documentation? Flickr?
* Collect your resources and make a [Storify](https://storify.com/) or a [Pinterest board](http://www.pinterest.com/) with your relevant quotes, pictures, documents.
* Share your curated resource with the [Discourse community](http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/training/building) and ask people to contribute further resources on your idea.
