#Make to learn tech skills and concepts.

## 1. Playtest your Teaching Kit

If you participated in the [Building module](http://training.webmakerprototypes.org/en/building/concepts/) of #TeachTheWeb, now is the perfect time to playtest the learning resources you made. (If you haven't yet done the Building module, try the DIY Learning Experience make below!)

Gather a few of your friends, family members or learners, and run your activities with them. What went right? What went wrong? Did your learners learn something? What would you change? Were all of your learning goals addressed? Were there other skills/competencies your learner acquired that you hadn’t thought of? What surprised you about your plan? Share your playtest and reflection with the [community](https://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/training/facilitating). Invite others who playested to document their feedback and include it in your reflection.

## 2. Playtest someone else's Teaching Kit

There are plenty of teaching kits on webmaker.org that you can use to level up your facilitation skills. Choose one that sounds interesting to you and gather some people to teach them something about the web. You can teach to 3 or 30 learners, for 30 minutes or 3 hours – test yourself, then reflect on your experience in the [community](https://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/training/facilitating). Be sure to mention people with an @[name] when you post your reflection.

## 3. Give Feedback and Talk to Strangers
Jump into the [community](http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/training/building) and start reviewing and commenting on other people's work. Being open and sharing your thoughts is a great way to train up for facilitating learning because open interaction is a keystone. 

Another great way to test your facilitating skills is to talk to strangers. Opening conversations with random people might seem a little intimdating, but the more you feel comfortable with what you do and do not "know", the better you'll help others learn....

## 4. DIY Learning Experience

If you didn't plan and create a lesson plan that embeds web competencies and skills with the learning goals you're most interested in teaching in the <a href="http://training.webmakerprototypes.org/en/building/concepts/">Building module</a>, you should do one now! Start by using [Paper Prototyping] (https://stuff.webmaker.org/teach-assets/kits/paper/TeachingKitDesignCanvas.pdf) to organize your thoughts, then try remixing our [Teaching Kit Template](https://thimble.webmaker.org/project/10274/remix?ref=training) to help frame your lesson. Think about what activities you would run. You can search webmaker.org for activities to try or make new activities with the help of the [Activity Template] (https://thimble.webmaker.org/project/10286/remix?ref=training).

Share your Teaching Kit with the [Discourse community](http://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/training/building), and personally ask 2-3 people to review it for constructive feedback.

## Make & Document to Reflect
* Write and share a blog post about your playtesting experiences or what it was like to facilitate this kind of learning.
* Collect the resources your participants made or make a [Storify](https://storify.com/) or a [Pinterest board](http://www.pinterest.com/) with  relevant quotes, pictures, documents.
* Share your playtesting outcome with the [Discourse community](https://discourse.webmakerprototypes.org/category/training/facilitating) and ask people to give constructive feedback on your teaching style.
