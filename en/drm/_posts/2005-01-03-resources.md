##Understanding DRM and Related Issues

>Digital Rights Management (DRM) technologies attempt to control what you can and can't do with the media and hardware you've purchased.

--EFF, [What is DRM?](https://www.eff.org/issues/drm)

>In the real world, "bare" DRM doesn't really do much. Before governments enacted laws making compromising DRM illegal (even if no copyright infringement took place), DRM didn't survive contact with the market for long.

--Cory Doctorow [What happens with DRM in the real world](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/feb/05/digital-rights-management)

>This is the worst of all the ideas embodied by DRM: that people who make record-players should be able to spec whose records you can listen to, and that people who make records should have a veto over the design of record-players.

--Cory Doctorow, [Microsoft Research DRM talk](http://craphound.com/msftdrm.txt)

>DRM requires closed systems to operate as currently required and is designed to remove user control, so Mozilla is taking steps to find alternative solutions to DRM. But Mozilla also believes that until an alternative system is in place, Firefox users should be able to choose whether to interact with DRM in order to watch streaming videos in the browser.

--Mitchell Baker, [DRM and the Challenge of Serving Users](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/05/14/drm-and-the-challenge-of-serving-users/)

>The price of success—introducing competition into the browser space—is that you don’t have leverage when you’re the only holdout against a industry-wide move in a different direction.

--Ben Moskowitz, [the Web is Changing](http://www.benmoskowitz.com/?p=982)

##Wikipedia Articles on Related Technologies and Policies

>The notion of "plugging the analog hole" may be based on fundamental misconceptions of the meaning of analog and digital.

--[Analog Hole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_hole)

>Content Scramble System (CSS) is a digital rights management (DRM) and encryption system employed on almost all commercially produced DVD-Video discs.

--[Content Scramble System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Scramble_System)

>The DMCA criminalizes production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures (commonly known as digital rights management or DRM) that control access to copyrighted works.

--[Digital Millennium Copyright Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act)

>On the one hand information wants to be expensive, because it's so valuable. The right information in the right place just changes your life. On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time. So you have these two fighting against each other.

--[Information wants to be free](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_wants_to_be_free)
