# Introduction
Although there are multiple and competing definitions of the term, DRM is often used as a shorthand for the group of technologies used to control the use of digital content after it has been sold to consumers. Perhaps the most familiar example is the copy-protection added to DVD and Blu-Ray discs. Publishers and copyright holders claim that DRM is necessary to prevent the illegal copying or altering of copyrighted material. 

In 2014, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the main international standards organization for the web, accepted calls from the entertainment industry add [Encrypted Media Extensions](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/html-media/raw-file/tip/encrypted-media/encrypted-media.html) (EME) to the HTML 5.1 specifications. Using this system, web browsers can use a 'Content Decryption Module' (CDM) to access restricted content. Up until this decision, publishers and copyright holders were forced to use increasingly-unpopular technologies such as Adobe Flash and Microsoft Silverlight to add digital locks to their content. 

Mozilla made the controversial decision to pursue a solution that would allow users of the Firefox web browser to access DRM-enabled content via EME. However, as Chairperson [Mitchell Baker](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/14/firefox-closed-source-drm-video-browser-cory-doctorow) said at the time, “this is not a happy day for the web.” More details about this decision can be found on [her blog](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2014/05/14/drm-and-the-challenge-of-serving-users/
).

# Reasons DRM is bad for the web
While there are some who see the inclusion of DRM in the specification for HTML 5.1 as a [victory](http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/05/drm-in-html5-is-a-victory-for-the-open-web-not-a-defeat/), there are many more opponents to it. [Cory Doctorow](http://craphound.com) is a science fiction author, activist, journalist and blogger well-known for his opposition to DRM. He came up with ['Doctorow's Law'](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/04/doctorows-law):

> Anytime someone puts a lock on something you own, against your wishes, and doesn't give you the key, they're not doing it for your benefit."

There are at least three main reasons why DRM on the web is something to be avoided:

1. DRM does not work
2. DRM is bad for users
3. DRM is bad for artists and copyright holders

## 1. DRM does not work
Like any lock, DRM doesn’t stop circumvention. Just as someone unable to unlock a door could climb in through a window, so there are ways around DRM for those [determined enough](http://archive.wired.com/politics/security/commentary/securitymatters/2005/11/69601):

> DRM  doesn’t stop people who scan books, or retype books. DRM doesn’t stop people who download widely available cracks that can remove all the  DRM  from an entire e-book collection. And DRM doesn’t stop people who  are  inclined to download the DRM-free pirate editions. All DRM does is punish legitimate users who had the misfortune to be so honest that they  paid for the book, rather than taking it.


## 2. DRM is bad for users
DRM technologies are, by their very nature, closed-source, meaning that people cannot inspect the source code of the software used to unlock the content they have purchased. There have been occasions, including the [2005 Sony rootkit case](http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/columns-and-blogs/cory-doctorow/article/53544-doubling-down-on-drm.html), where DRM software installed by users to  access content compromised their entire system - leaving it wide open for hackers.

Due to DRM software and hardware being closed-source and proprietary, reverse-engineering it is illegal. This means that any security vulnerabilities can only be found and remedied by the small group of people who have access to the source code. Worse than this, however, is that security vulnerability reporting is not allowed, as it depends upon reverse-engineering. Exploits around privacy and security can go unpatched for months or years until those with access to the source code notice the problem and do something about it.

## 3. DRM is bad for artists and copyright holders
The implicit message behind DRM is that the people who hold the copyright should be able to dictate what kind of devices can access the copyright work. This stifles innovation, relying on vested interests to dictate what comes next. Innovation and creativity comes from [unexpected places](http://craphound.com/msftdrm.txt) - think of coffee warmers that plug into USB sockets, or things that can be powered by car ‘cigarette lighter’ sockets:
 
> Today's copyright -- the thing that DRM nominally props up -- didn't come down off the mountain on two stone tablets. It was created in living memory to accommodate the technical reality created by the inventors of the previous generation. To abandon invention now robs tomorrow's artists of the new businesses and new reach and new audiences that the Internet and the PC can give them.


# Trusted Computing
As stated above, DRM is the name given to the group of technologies that control access to content after that content has been purchased. On the web, this is usually dealt with as a browser plugin (e.g. Firefox), or built into the web browser itself. 

There have been moves to lock down 'open' systems at a lower level than the browser through initiatives such as 'Trusted Computing' (TC). There are some stated benefits of TC, such as ensuring the user is not subject to viruses and malware, and that networks remain secure. However, the technologies that are involved remove the ultimate control of files on the device  from the user. A [famous example](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/technology/companies/18amazon.html?_r=0) of this is Amazon's ability to remotely-delete e-books from its Kindle e-reader device.

TC uses encryption to enforce certain behaviors on devices. Encryption is a way of scrambling a message so that only a person or system with the key to unlock it can gain access. It can be implemented by users to ensure that their files are secured for their own benefit. However, in the case of TC, encryption is used to secure hardware for the benefit of copyright holders, governments, and corporations. [Jonathan Zittrain](http://yupnet.org/zittrain/archives/14) calls this 'tethering':

> The traditional appliance, or nearly any object, for that matter, once placed with an individual, belongs to that person. Tethered appliances  belong to a new class of technology. They are appliances in that they are easy to use, while not easy to tinker with. They are tethered because it is easy for their vendors to change them from afar, long after the devices have left warehouses and showrooms.

Tethered devices are more easily to surveil than devices that respect user sovereignty. While a subsection of users may be willing to trade their privacy for a marginally better experience, it has led to some commentators likening it to a modern-day [panopticon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon). Zittrain also points out that laws are subject to interpretation and revision, something that black and white technical interpretations do not take into account. Although a much wider and more philosophical question, technology should not constrain human moral choices. This is an even more acute issue in countries with repressive regimes.

# What you can do to defeat DRM
DRM exists because users accept it. It is a technological solution to a perceived social problem: how can copyright holders ensure people don't steal their content? DRM as a solution to this distribution problem trumps the rights of users to do what they see fit with the content they have legitimately purchased. For example, unless you want to buy it twice, purchasing a film on Blu-Ray and converting it to a format you can watch on your tablet often involves circumventing DRM.
